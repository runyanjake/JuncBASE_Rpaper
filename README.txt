Notes to Jake

Python version I had to use was 3.6.1 (will this work with the rest of JuncBASE?)
R version and rpy2 versions were just the latest versions.

Generally working function call: python3 test.py

See here for using rpy2 vectors with R: http://rpy2.readthedocs.io/en/version_2.8.x/introduction.html#calling-r-functions
Here is a good documentation for rpy2: http://rpy.sourceforge.net/rpy2/doc-2.1/html/robjects.html
